Analyzed time series by applying methods such as natural visibility, horizontal visibility graphs methods to extract time series features such as Avg degree, network diameter, Avg path length for each human activity (walking, running, etc.) based on accelerometer signals. Evaluated permutation entropy and complexity for accelerometer signals and visualized the parameters through scatter plots
